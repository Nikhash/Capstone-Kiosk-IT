Software:

Unity version 6000.0.45f1
Probuilder package in Unity - it's like a very simple Blender tool inside Unity



Usage:

- Install Unity Hub and create an account
- Install Unity editor version 6000.0.45f1
- Download the project from Github at https://github.com/Nikhash/Capstone-Kiosk-IT
- Unpack from zip file
- In Unity Hub click "Add" -> "Add project from disk" and locate the folder you unpacked and the project will open

Models and parts can be edited, but I strongly suggest having somene with experience with Unity to do it
You can move around the scene by right clicking inside the Scene window and pressing w/a/s/d
You can change how the scene is shown (draw modes) on the circle buttons on the Scene window's top toolbar
